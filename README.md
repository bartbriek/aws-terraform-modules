# aws-terraform-modules
Terraform modules that contain battle tested AWS infrastructure as code.

# Goal
It is hard to build highly scalable, secure and maintainable infrastructure. Terraform
helps with doing it in a way to build consistent modules that can be used in a modular sense.
This repository should grow into simple to use terraform modules that can be called individually
and work solely on input.

# To do:
Focus will be on the serverless stack within AWS first.
